### Hi there, I'm Katherine! 👋

<!--
**katherine-taylor/katherine-taylor** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🎓 I'm a recent graduate of the University of Virginia, with a double major in Systems Engineering and Statistics
- 📊 I currently work as a business analyst, but I'm looking at getting into more technical roles
- 🎶 In my spare time I enjoy playing my bassoon, listening to classical music, and reading
